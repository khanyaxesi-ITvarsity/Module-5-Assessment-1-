            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p class="intro">
            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun.    
            </p>
            <p>It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.</p>
            <p>Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.</p>
